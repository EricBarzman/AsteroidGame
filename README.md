# ASTEROID #

This is my attempt at coding with `JavaScript` the classic "Asteroid" game!

## Description of the project ##

### Trigonometry ###

Most of the game relies on trigonometry (calculations according to angles) to manage the ship's movement, as well as the asteroids'.

### Kinetic, particles, lasers and stuff ###

The game also features :

- random particles
  - these are used for explosions
  - but also to create the pattern of stars in the background
- arrays containing :
  
  - lasers
  - particles
  - obstacles
- collision detection.

### Sound effects ###

Not that many, to preserve the "immersive" experience the game provides through its sheer simplicity, but still.

### Lives, scores etc ###

And of course, the usual stuff you'd expect in a game :

- lives
- score
- a high score...

## Controls ##

Rotate the ship's nose left with the `left arrow`, right with the `right arrow`, and thrust forward with the `up arrow`.
Remember, this is space. So, (almost) no friction will stop you!
Shoot lasers with `space`.

### Goal of the game ###

Destroy all the Asteroids and have fun!
